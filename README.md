## Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a simple Etch-a-Sketch web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to draw on a 16x16 grid by hovering over the cells, which change color upon interaction. The grid dynamically adapts based on user input, demonstrating DOM manipulation and event handling.
